Description of the PCAP Files

    Format: The files are in standard .pcap format, which can be opened with tools such as Wireshark, tcpdump, or any other packet analysis software.
    Contents: The PCAP files include simulated netwrok traffic which contains:
        Normal traffic patterns
        Anomalous or malicious traffic (e.g., simulated attacks, suspicious activity)
        Specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP)
    Purpose: These files are designed for use in:
        Dataset Creation
        Network traffic analysis
        Machine learning and cybersecurity research
        Training and evaluation of intrusion detection systems (IDS)

How to Use the PCAP Files

    Download the PCAP files from the link above.
    Open the files with a network analysis tool such as:
        Wireshark (GUI-based tool)
        tcpdump (command-line tool)
        scapy (Python library for packet analysis and manipulation)
    Analyze the traffic or use it in your research workflows.
